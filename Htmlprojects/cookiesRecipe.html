     <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

     <ul>
        <li>1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>½ cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups (315g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Instructions:</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>
            Cream butter and sugars: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add eggs and vanilla: Mix in the eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract and combine well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>Fold in chocolate chips: Gently stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Scoop and bake: Drop tablespoon-sized scoops onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Cool: Let cookies rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        
     </ol>


     <h2>Tips for the Best Cookies:</h2>

    <ul>✔ Use room-temperature butter for a smooth texture. <br>
✔ Chill the dough for 30 minutes for thicker cookies. <br>
✔ Do not overbake—they will continue cooking as they cool. <br>
</ul>

<strong>Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies! 🍪😋</strong>
