    <strong>    Hey there 👋!
        I'm Omid (pronounced O-meed) — a former engineer 👷, content creator 📺, writer ✍️, marketer 📈, SEO fanatic 💻, and amateur cook 🍳.</strong> <br><br>
‍
After an incredible run leading SEO and content marketing as an early Webflow employee, I took all of my learnings and built this media website.<br><br>

Over the past couple of years, I've amassed millions of blog readers, grew a newsletter to over 16,200 brilliant marketers and founders, and created a repeatable framework for B2B SaaS brands to follow to grow their revenue from SEO.
<br><br>
I live and breathe content marketing and SEO. And because I run a marketing newsletter, I always have my finger on the pulse of what's going on — especially around SEO and the rise of AI search.
<br><br>
Unlike a traditional agency, I don't lock people into contracts (although most clients never want to stop working together). But, I only work with a few SaaS companies at a time. This allows me to give each company the crucial attention it needs. If we work together, you can be confident knowing I'm doing all of the work with (and for) you — from initial strategy to scale.
