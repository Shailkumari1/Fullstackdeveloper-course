On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.2% following the 0.5% increase recorded in January. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.1% on a yearly basis. This print followed the 3.3% increase in January.
                <br><br>
                India’s consumer inflation: India’s retail inflation, which is measured through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), eased down to 3.61% in the month of February as compared to 5.09% in February a year ago. The retail inflation stood at 4.26% in January 2025. 
                <br><br>
                IIP data: Index of Industrial Production (IIP), which measures India’s industrial output, grew by 5% in January, from 3.5% in December 2024. The data showed that the manufacturing sector’s output grew 5.5% in January as against 3.6% in the year-ago period. This is a positive, indicating that demand is picking up in the country.

            <p>Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor interacted with the media last night as they celebrated the Jigra actor's birthday. Their daughter Raha Kapoor was not a part of the event.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Bollywood couple Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor requested the media to refrain from sharing unauthorised pictures of their daughter Raha Kapoor. On Wednesday, the couple celebrated Alia's 31st birthday in advance with media in Mumbai.
                <br><br>

               <strong>Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor request media to not share unauthorised pictures of Raha</strong> <br><br>
                While answering questions from the press, Alia Bhatt clarified that while she doesn't want to take legal action against those using Raha's pictures, they might consider it if people don't respect their decision.
                <br><br>
                
                The Jigra actor said, "We don’t want to push any sort of (legal) action, but we’ll be left with no choice if people don’t listen. Wait for Raha to cross or cover her face while clicking pictures.”
                <br><br>
                
                “My worst nightmare is someone breaking in and taking Raha away,” she also added.
                <br><br>
                
                Ranbir told the press that while they are not considering the legal route yet, he also emphasised that he ‘grew up in Mumbai, in the industry.’ He addressed everyone as ‘family.’ 
                <br><br>
                
                “We are requesting you for the betterment of my child. It might sound like a privileged problem. But as parents, we are trying to do as much as we can to protect our child. Anybody with a camera phone can post it, it’s not in our control. But we are just asking for help,” he said.
                <br><br>
                
                Ranbir on Alia's privacy breach
                Referring to the time when Alia was clicked at her Mumbai house without her consent, Ranbir added, "Woh to bohot galat baat hai (it was very wrong). We understand there’s curiosity, but there’s a line you cannot cross.”</p>

            <h3>Market sell-off wipes out Rs 2.33 lakh crore from mutual fund retail assets in February</h3>
            <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/03/Stock-market-1.jpg?w=640" height="300px" width="400px" alt="stock market">

            <p>Gross equity inflows also saw a reduction of 18 per cent, falling from Rs 66,630 crore in January 2025 to Rs 54,428 crore in February.</p> <hr>

            <p>The sell-off in the stock market has dealt a heavy blow to the mutual fund industry with assets of retail investors in various funds plummeting by Rs 2.33 lakh crore and inflows into small-cap and mid-cap schemes plunging by up to 34.9 per cent in the month of February. <br><br>

                Highlighting the vulnerability of mutual fund investments to market volatility, retail assets under management (AUM), including equity, hybrid and solution-oriented schemes, plummeted to Rs 36,44,112 crore in February from Rs 38,77,595 crore in January this year, according to figures released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).
                <br><br>
                
                This decline occurred during a period of significant market correction due to multiple external factors primarily global trade tensions created by uncertainty on US tariffs. “This resulted in the benchmark BSE Sensex TRI experiencing a month-on-month decline of over 5.5 per cent,” said Jatinder Pal Singh, CEO, ITI Mutual Fund.
                <br><br>
                
                Significantly, mutual fund industry’s overall AUM declined by Rs 2.71 lakh crore to Rs 64,53,493 crore in February 2025 as against Rs 67,25,449 crore in January. While net investments in the small-cap fund category decreased by 34.9 per cent to Rs 3,722.46 crore, and inflows into mid-cap funds fell by 33.8 per cent to Rs 3,406.95 crore, large-cap funds experienced a more modest decline of just 6.4 per cent, reaching Rs 2,866 crore.</p>

            <h3>India ‘super important’ market, to discuss potential partnerships with IndiGo, Air India: Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas</h3>

            <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/03/riyadh-air.jpg?w=640" height="300px" width="400px" alt="import market">

            <p>Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas is in New Delhi as part of a Riyadh Air delegation for meetings with India’s aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to discuss the requisite permissions and support for launch of the airline’s India operations.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Saudi Arabia’s ambitious new airline Riyadh Air considers India a “super important” market and will explore potential partnerships with Indian carriers IndiGo and Air India in addition to its plans of operating flights between the two countries as passenger flows between India and Saudi Arabia are growing rapidly, Riyadh Air’s Chief Executive Officer Tony Douglas said Wednesday. Saudi Arabia expects India to become its largest source market for tourism by 2030, and Indian nationals are already the biggest non-Saudi resident group in that country, making India a lucrative market for Riyadh Air.

                <br><br>

                Douglas is in New Delhi as part of a Riyadh Air delegation for meetings with India’s aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to discuss the requisite permissions and support for launch of the airline’s India operations. Douglas is also slated to meet top executives of IndiGo and Air India to discuss possible partnerships.
                <br><br>
                
                The Riyadh-based full-service airline, which is Saudi Arabia’s second national carrier alongside Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) and is slated to start commercial operations later this year, has already forged partnerships with various global airlines including Delta Air Lines, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, China Eastern, Air China, and Egypt Air.
                <br><br>
                
                Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the force behind Riyadh Air, which aims to fly to over 100 destinations by 2030. The airline has 39 wide-body Boeing 787 aircraft on order, with an option to expand the order size to 72 jets, in addition to 60 Airbus A321 narrow-body planes.

                <br><br>
                
                According to Douglas, Riyadh Air currently has two major gaps in its airline partnerships — North-Western Europe and India — and it wants to cover those.
                <br><br>
                
                Speaking to reporters in Delhi, while Douglas did not elaborate on the likely talks between Riyadh Air and the Indian airlines, he said that the conversations at this early stage would be mostly exploratory, and expressed keenness to forge partnerships in India as long as they are a “win-win” proposition for Riyadh Air as well as the potential partner airline.</p>
