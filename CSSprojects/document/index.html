        <h1>About - Branching and Merging</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Branching and Merging</h3>
       <p>
        The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.
        <br> <br>

        Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

        <br><br>
        
        This means that you can do things like: <br>
        
        Frictionless Context Switching. Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.
        <br><br>
        Role-Based Codelines. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.
        <br><br>
        Feature Based Workflow. Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
        <br><br>
        Disposable Experimentation. Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the work—with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).
        <br>

      <h1>Documentation</h1>
      <p>
        You need to create a document or a set of documents. Perhaps this is project documentation or your network logging, or something simpler. For example, you need to describe the processes inside the company or your department. In general, we are talking about any document or set of documents containing text, figures, tables… Let’s complicate the task by the fact that:

        <br><br>

This involves joint work, as well as the efforts of a group or several groups of employees
As a result, you want to have a document in a certain format, having corporate style attributes, and created according to a certain template. To be specific, let’s consider it as MS Word (.docx)
<br><br>
10 years ago, the approach would have been quite unambiguous: we would have created an MS Word document or documents and somehow organized editing.
<br><br>
This approach is still valid. It is even used by large integrators when creating project documentation. However, it is intuitively clear that if your work on a document is long-term, intensive, and includes many edits and discussions, this approach is not quite convenient.
