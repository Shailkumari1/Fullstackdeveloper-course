            <p>
                What is ‚Äúversion control‚Äù, and why should you care? Version control is
                a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so
                that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this
                book, you will use software source code as the files being version
                controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of
                file on a computer. If you are a graphic or web designer and want to
                keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most
                certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise
                thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a
                previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state,
                compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might
                be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
                Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose
                files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very
                little overhead. Local Version Control Systems Many people‚Äôs
                version-control method of choice is to copy files into another
                directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they‚Äôre clever). This
                approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also
                incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you‚Äôre in
                and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don‚Äôt
                mean to. To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local
                VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files
                under revision control.

            <p>
                <h3>Mailing List</h3>
                General questions or comments for the Git community can be sent to the mailing list by using the email
                address git@vger.kernel.org. <br>

                If you wish to report any possible bug for Git, please use this mailing list as well. <br>

                You do not need to subscribe: you will be Cc'd in replies. Please keep the Cc list intact when replying
                (use "Reply to all"). Greylisting may delay your first post for a few hours. Note also that the list
                only accepts plain-text email; please disable HTML in your outgoing messages. <br> <br>

                By subscribing (click here), you can make sure you're not missing follow-up discussions and you can also
                learn about other development in the community. The list archive can be found on lore.kernel.org. <br><br>

                Windows-specific questions can also be asked at Git for Windows' discussions (if in doubt whether your
                question is Windows-specific, or if you prefer mailing lists or want to avoid GitHub, just use the
                general Git mailing list). Please submit Windows-specific bugs to Git for Windows' bug tracker. <br><br>

                If you're a downstream packager of Git, consider joining the Git packagers mailing list for low-volume
                announcements from the developers, as well as other discussion related to packaging & porting Git. <br><br>

               <h3> Bug Reporting</h3>
                Bugs in git can be reported directly to the mailing list (see above for details). Note that you do not
                need to subscribe to the list to send to it. You can help us out by attempting to reproduce the bug in
                the latest released version of git, or if you're willing to build git from source, the next branch.
                Sometimes an attempted fix may be pending in this branch, in which case your feedback as to whether the
                fix worked for you will be appreciated. <br><br>

                If you are using git 2.27.0 or later, you can run git bugreport in the repository where you observed the
                bug, which generates a template to guide you through writing a useful bug report and gathers some
                diagnostic information about your environment. <br><br>

                Bugs related to this website can be reported at its issue tracker. Bugs related to the content of the
                "Pro Git" book can be reported at its issue tracker. <br><br>

                If you are new to submitting bugs, you might find this guide helpful for producing useful bug reports.
                 <br><br>
               <h3> Reporting Security Issues</h3>
                Issues which are security relevant should be disclosed privately to the Git Security mailing list.
                <br><br>
               <h3> IRC Channel</h3>
                If the manpages and this book aren‚Äôt enough and you need in-person help, you can try the #git channel on
                the Libera Chat IRC server (irc.libera.chat). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of
                people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help. The #git-devel channel
                welcomes Git development discussion, and might be able to help you contribute to Git. <br><br>

                If you need specific help about one of the for-profit Git hosting sites, you might try their own IRC
                channels (such as #github or #gitlab) on the same IRC server. <br><br>

               <h3> Discord Server</h3>
                The Git Community Discord Server also has many knowledgeable and helpful people. Additionally, it
                provides a space to be able to voice chat about patches, designs, or anything else Git related.
                <br><br>

              <h3>  Newsletter</h3>
                There is a monthly community newsletter called "Git Rev News", with its archive and its latest edition.
                Information on how to subscribe can be found on the dedicated webpage.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Contributing to Git</h3>
                The Documentation directory in the Git source code has several files of interest to developers who are
                looking to help contribute. After reading the coding guidelines and code of conduct, you can learn how
                to submit patches. If you are just starting out, you can read the My First Contribution tutorial. For
                those looking to get more deeply involved, there is a howto for Git maintainers. <br><br>

                The Git Developer Pages have a Hacking Git page which lists useful development resources. They also have
                information for people applying to work on Git as part of programs like Outreachy or the Google Summer
                of Code. <br><br>
            </p>
